he first hedge-fund manager, Alfred Winslow Jones, did not go to 
business school. He did not possess a PhD in quantitative finance. 
He  did  not  spend  his  formative  years  at  Morgan  Stanley,  Gold-
man Sachs, or any other incubator for masters of the universe. Instead, he 
took a job on a tramp steamer, studied at the Marxist Workers School in 
Berlin,  and  ran  secret  missions  for  a  clandestine  anti-Nazi  group  called  
the  Leninist  Organization.  He  married,  divorced,  and  married  again,  
honeymooning on the front lines of the civil war in Spain, traveling and 
drinking  with  Dorothy  Parker  and  Ernest  Hemingway.  It  was  only  at  
the advanced age of forty-eight that Jones raked together $100,000 to set 
up a “hedged fund,” generating extraordinary profits through the 1950s 
and 1960s. Almost by accident, Jones improvised an investment structure 
that  has  endured  to  this  day.  It  will  thrive  for  years  to  come,  despite  a  
cacophony of naysayers. 
Half a century after Jones created his hedge fund, a young man named 
Clifford  Asness  followed  in  his  footsteps.  Asness  did  attend  a  business  
school.  He  did  acquire  a  PhD  in  quantitative  finance.  He  did  work  for  
Goldman Sachs, and he was a master of the universe. Whereas Jones had 
launched his venture in his mature, starched-collar years, Asness rushed 
into the business at the grand old age of thirty-one, beating all records for

a new start-up by raising an eye-popping $1 billion. Whereas Jones had 
been discreet about his methods and the riches that they brought, Asness 
was refreshingly open, tearing up his schedule to do TV interviews and 
confessing to the New York Times that “it doesn’t suck” to be worth mil-
lions.1 By the eve of the subprime mortgage crash in 2007, Asness’s fi rm, 
AQR  Capital  Management,  was  running  a  remarkable  $38  billion  and  
Asness himself personified the new globe-changing finance. He was irrev-
erent, impatient, and scarcely even bothered to pretend to be grown up. 
He had a collection of plastic superheroes in his offi ce.2 
Asness freely recognized his debt to Jones’s improvisation. His hedge 
funds, like just about all hedge funds, embraced four features that Jones 
had  combined  to  spectacular  effect.  To  begin  with,  there  was  a  perfor-
mance fee: Jones kept one fifth of the fund’s investment profits for himself 
and his team, a formula that sharpened the incentives of his lieutenants. 
Next,  Jones  made  a  conscious  effort  to  avoid  regulatory  red  tape,  pre-
serving the flexibility to shape-shift from one investment method to the 
next as market opportunities mutated. But most important, from Asness’s 
perspective, were two ideas that had framed Jones’s investment portfolio. 
Jones had balanced purchases of promising shares with “short selling” of 
unpromising ones, meaning that he borrowed and sold them, betting that 
they would fall in value. By being “long” some stocks and “short” others, 
he insulated his fund at least partially from general market swings; and 
having  hedged  out  market  risk  in  this  fashion,  he  felt  safe  in   magnify- 
ing,  or  “leveraging,”  his  bets  with  borrowed  money.  As  we  wil l  see  in   
the next chapter, this combination of hedging and leverage had a magi-
cal  effect  on  Jones’s  portfolio  of  stocks.  But  its  true  genius  was  the  one  
that Asness emphasized later: The same combination could be applied to 
bonds, futures, swaps, and options—and indeed to any mixture of these 
instruments. More by luck than by design, Jones had invented a platform 
for strategies more complex than he himself could dream of. 
No  definition  of  hedge  funds  is  perfect,  and  not  all  the  adventures  
recounted in this book involve hedging and leverage. When George Soros 
and  Stan  Druckenmiller  broke  the  British  pound,  or  when  John  Paulson  
shorted the mortgage bubble in the United States, there was no particular
